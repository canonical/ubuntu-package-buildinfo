    Downloads the buildlog, changes files and changelog for a package version in a series and extracts

    It also verifies that the buildinfo file is correct based on the checksum in the .changes file.

    * First we query the Ubuntu archive for the source package version in the specified series and pocket.
    * If the source package version is not found we query the archive for the binary package version in

    * If the binary package version is found we get the source package name from the binary package and
        query the archive for the source package version in the specified series and pocket.
    * If the source package version is found we download the buildlog, changes file and changelog for the
        source package version in the specified series and pocket.
